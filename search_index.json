["video-overview.html", "2 Video Overview 2.1 Data Cleaning Pipeline 2.2 Visualization Reasoning and Caveats:", " 2 Video Overview 2.1 Data Cleaning Pipeline The figure above shows the data cleaning pipeline for video data. Raw tracklog and video data is initially stored in Google BigQuery. It is downloaded and cleaned programatically through the populate_courses.py script. Next, the cleaned wrangled_video_heat.csv file is used to generate the video visualizations. 2.2 Visualization Reasoning and Caveats: The main purpose of the plot shown above is to gain the trust of the instructor. Intuitively, we know that videos that occur later in the course are going to have less students because students are more likely drop the course. Additionally, this plot is a good introductory to the next plot. Initially, during usability testing, when showing the heat map plot below without showing the length of video plot above, instructors felt overwhelmed and had trouble interpretting the visualization. The heat map plot above shows which parts of the video are being viewed the most. The “watch rate” of each segment is calculated by the following equation: \\[\\text{Watch Rate} = (\\frac{\\text{Number of times a segment has been watched}}{\\text{Number of unique students who have started the video}})\\] In the above calculation of the watch rate, the “number of times a segment has been watched” is the raw count regardless of uniqueness of the user. This means that is a new user watches a video segment twice, the “number of times a segment has been watched” will increase by two The plot above was created as a request from usability testing. This shows the average maximum time that a users reach in a video. However, the diagram is slightly misleading. We are simply taking the maximum time that users reach in a video. We are not accounting for the fact that users max have skipped ahead in video time to achieved their maximum time in the video. This problem can be fixed relatively easily in future iterations. The plot above shows instructors which segments have abnormally high and low watch rates. It works by creating a linear model used to predict the watch rate of a given segment. The linear model is based on the video’s occurrence in the course as well as the segment’s position within the video. Once the predicted value has been calculated, segments with the highest and lowest residuals are highlighted. The table above shows much of the information already displayed in the visualizations above. During usability testing, it was discovered that users often want to see the actual numbers as well as the visualiations. "],

These files are obtained from Google BigQuery. Typically, these files are automatically obtained through the “populate_courses.py” script within the “exec” directory. input_course corresponds to the “short name” within the “.config.json” file The following are descriptions of the columns within the output csv file: video_id: Video ID hash string video_name: Name of the video username: Username of the learner min_into_video: Minute into video of the segment that the learner has watched count: Number of times the learner has watched the segment mode: Whether or not the learner is auditing or a verified student certified: Whether or not the student has been certified gender: Gender of the learner activity_level: Length of time that the student has spent on the course max_stop_position: The mode time at which video_stop events occur. The mode is used instead of the maximum because some videos have video_stop events that occur at incorrect times such as 3 days. course_order: Order in which the video appears in the course index_chapter: Index of the chapter in which the video appears in chapter: Name of the chapter Each video segment is 20 seconds in length. This can be adjusted by changing the global constant SEGMENT_SIZE in the video_wrangling.R file. In order for a segment to be counted as being “viewed”, the user would have to watch the segment for at least 1 second before carrying out another event such as video_pause, video_seek, page_close etc. This threshold of 1 second can be adjusted via the global constant MIN_DURATION in the video_wrangling.R file. The largest length of a video is set to be 1 hour. Any segments passed 1 hour will simply be ignored/truncated. This can be adjusted by changing the global constant MAX_DURATION in the video_wrangling.R file. 3.1.2 obtain_raw_video_data 3.1.2.1 Main Documentation Reads raw uncleaned .csv into a dataframe Description: Reads the raw generalized_video_heat.csv obtained through rbq.py into a dataframe.

It should be noted that this diagram may be misleading. Please see documentation for get_aggregated_df for more details. 3.2.10 get_rank 3.2.10.1 Main Documentation Returns the ranking of a vector x Description: Returns the ranking of a vector x Usage: get_rank(x) Arguments: x: A vector of numeric values Value: &#39;g&#39;: The ranking of the values within x Examples: get_rank(c(10, 20, 20, 22, 5)) 3.2.10.2 Additional Notes: This function returns a data frame in which the the duration watched per minute video is calculated. This is calculated by (average time spent on video (minutes) by all learners who have started the video)/(length of video (minutes)) It should be noted that the average time spent on video is calculated via the count in which the segment has been watched multiplied by the segment length. As a result, if users are consistently only watching 3 seconds of a 20 second segment, this number may be artificially inflated. This is because if a student watches more than 1 second of a segment, it will count as a “view”/“count” of the segment. This 1 second threshold can be adjusted via adjusting the global constant MIN_DURATION found in the video_wrangling.R file. "],
["general-demographics-overview.html", "4 General Demographics Overview 4.1 Data Cleaning Pipeline 4.2 Visualization Reasoning and Caveats:", " 4 General Demographics Overview 4.1 Data Cleaning Pipeline The figure above shows the data cleaning pipeline for demographics data. Raw student demographics data is initially stored in Google BigQuery. It is downloaded and cleaned programatically through the populate_courses.py script. Next, the cleaned wrangle_demographics.csv file is used to generate the video visualizations. It should be noted that the data obtained through the use of generalized_demographics.sql and rbq.py is not the entire dataset of students. Instead, only students with a known IP address are obtained. This was done because IP address is used to infer statistics such as country and language. Please see generalized_demographics.sql for details. 4.2 Visualization Reasoning and Caveats: The plot above shows the level of education of the students. This is obtained from the LoE variable within the person_course table found on Google BigQuery. In order to transform the level of education code to its actual human readable format such as “Doctorate” or “High School”, the function convert_loe is used. This function assumes that the codes of “p”, “p_se”, and “p_oth” all refer to PhD which translates to a level of education of “Doctorate” in the visualization above. This assumption may not be entirely correct but are based off of the options available on EdX account profiles: The plot above shows the top ten countries according to the number of students enrolled. Student’s country is inferred from their IP addresses within the variable cc_by_ip. This was done because the variable countryLabel available in the person_course BigQuery table is relatively sparse compared to cc_by_ip. The plot above shows the top ten languages according to the number of students that speak it. The students’ language is inferred from their country which is in turn, inferred from their IP address. This was done because the language variable within the person_course table in BigQuery was obtained through their modal video transcripts. The original language variable seemed very biased towards English and as a result, the the students’ language was chosen to be inferred from their country. The plot above shows the distribution of ages amongs the learners. It should be noted that all ages less than 5 and greater than 100 have been filtered out. This was done because their are often fake accounts that entered a year of birth such that their age would be 200 or greater. As a result, the histogram would be difficult to read. The thresholds of 5 and 100 can be adjusted through the constants MIN_AGE and MAX_AGE found within the general_server.R file. Developer Note: The global constants should be transitioned into arguments passed into the get_age_plot function within the general_server.R file. "],

So we designed this Eiffel Tower engagement overview visulization to show the course structure vs.student engagement. Each bar is a course element (video, problem or module seperator), which is sorted based on their location in the whole course structure from the beginning to the end. The length of each bar indicates how many student engaged with this course element. 8.2 Purpose This visulization aims to help instructor finish four types of tasks : Obtain an intuitive sense about course structure. For example, instuctor can explore which module are excessive intensive containing too many elements. See where did the students dropout. Quickly locate to a specific video/problem by applying module filtering. Explore pattern by applying demographic filtering. For example, instuctor can explore whether there is engagement difference between audit student and verified student. 8.3 Implemenation Pipeline "],
["link-and-page-overview.html", "9 Link and Page Overview 9.1 Motivation 9.2 Purpose 9.3 Implemenation Pipeline", " 9 Link and Page Overview 9.1 Motivation It’s common that instructors often put external links in their MOOC courses. These links are towards some supplementary reference materials like an article, a book or a video etc. So, student engagement with these links should also be measured. Besides, page is one the most granular units in MOOC course design. But now intructor are unable to get access to know the actual traffic of pages, like syllabus page or reading page etc. So, student engagement with non-video/ non-problem pages should also be measured. 9.2 Purpose These two summary tables aims to help instructors finish two tasks: Detect external links which have abnormal click, then refine links choices. Detect pages which have abnormal pageview, then redesign pages. 9.3 Implemenation Pipeline "]
